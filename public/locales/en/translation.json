        "p1": "I am a facialist, lymphatic drainage practitioner, and skincare coach, but above all, I am a woman who has walked a path of reconciliation with herself. When I was younger, I was self-conscious about my skin and thought I had to scrub it raw to be accepted. That period left a deep mark on me. ü™û",
        "p2": "Over time, I realized that true beauty isn't found in the eyes of others, but in the alignment between who we are inside and what we express on the outside. Beauty is a reconnection with oneself‚Äîa truth you embody without masks or pretenses. üßòüèø‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è",
        "p3": "Today, I am guided by a holistic approach, both spiritual and rooted in body care. I support those who want to rediscover a beauty that feels right for them, that heals, that liberates. My role is to help you care for your skin, your energy, and your being, so you can feel fully yourself‚Äîaligned and radiant. üå∏",
