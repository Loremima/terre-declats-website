                                The quiet introspection of lockdown became my moment of revelation: I found my true calling in the art of well-being ðŸŒ±. This pivotal time led me not only to deeper self-discovery but also to sharing my passion, culminating in the publication of my book on natural wellness in February.

                                My journey began with formal training in aesthetics (CAP EsthÃ©tique), but my thirst for knowledge never ceased. I pursued specialized certifications, becoming a facialist adept in Hydrafacial treatments and mastering the Renata FranÃ§a lymphatic drainage technique. These skills, combined with extensive training in Kobido facial massage, allow me to offer truly bespoke and effective treatments.

                                My own path, marked by questions of self-acceptance, has shaped a unique philosophy of care. I profoundly believe in the transformative power of beauty rituals and dedicated self-care for women.

                                It is this conviction that fuels my mission, leading to the opening of my own sanctuary in September 2024 â€“ an institute exclusively for women, focusing on lymphatic drainage and the harmonious balance of body and mind.
